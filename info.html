            <p>Music has the power to trigger memories, for example, listening to a specific song may bring you back to
                a specific moment in time, or another song may remind you of a specific person.
                <br><br>
                All memories also have audio attached to them. For example, Steve Jobs announcing the first iPhone in
                2007.

                <i>What would it look like to visualize these audios?</i>
                <br><br>
                Visualizing these auditory experiences provides a new way to experience and remember the memory. Perhaps
                it could even deepen our understanding of the memory or enhance the emotional connection.
            </p>

            My goal with this project was to use creative coding and generative design to create visuals that
            encapsulate the emotional journey of memories associated with audio.
            <br><br>

            The visuals are generated in Processing, using the Minim library to extract data from the audio input. Audio
            is loaded into the code, and used to generate a visual output by taking the frequency spectrum and amplitude
            to draw the image. The image is comprised of only circles, and the size and color of each one is controlled
            by the audio input.
